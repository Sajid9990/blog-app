A zebra with a sunburn! As funny as it might be, the mystery behind the unique stripes has boggled experts for a long time.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_0_14\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_0_14_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The reason for their contrasting black and white stripes has intrigued great Victorian biologists like Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin.</p>\\n<p>While there have been almost 20 different theories about why zebras have the stripes, there seems to be no conclusion as such. Some believe the pattern helps in camouflage and some think the stripes act like marks of uniqueness (just like the human fingerprint).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_1_15\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_1_15_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>There have also been theories that the stripes help in thermoregulation (a process that lets your body maintain its core internal temperature) and protection from&nbsp;biting flies. Various experiments have shown that flies tend to not land on striped surfaces. So, the protection from bites of flies seems to be a very popular theory when it comes to answering why exactly do zebras have stripes.</p>\\n<p>Guess we will have to wait for the debate to reach a consensus. Meanwhile, there is another aspect of the zebra stripes that is equally fascinating. The pattern of the stripes and the intensity is different across species and the location. While most of us think that zebras are white with black stripes, it is not really true!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_2_29\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_2_29_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This common belief comes from the fact that the black stripes often end on the belly and towards the inside of the legs. This reveals that the rest of the body of the zebra is white. However, when it comes to zebras, looks are deceiving.</p>\\n<p>The fur of the zebra grows from follicles that contain&nbsp;melanocyte&nbsp;cells that are responsible for producing the melanin (a pigment that gives colour to hair and skin). When it comes to zebras, chemical messengers decide which melanocytes deliver pigment to which section of fur. This is what results in the black and white pattern and the variation in the stripes is owing to genetics.</p>\\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the white fur on the zebra is owing to an&nbsp;absence&nbsp;of melanin, and hence, the default colour of the zebra is black. If you shave a zebra, you will barely recognise it as an all-black animal. A member of the Equus genus, there are three living species of zebras in eastern and southern Africa. They have a coat of dark hair that is broken by stripes of white which is essentially unpigmented hair.</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"}"
