For instance, did you know that they&nbsp;are near-sighted?</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_0_14\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_0_14_other\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This sounds shocking since their night vision and peripheral vision are better than ours. Another interesting cat trivia is that they can jump up to 6 times their length! They are also known to walk like giraffes and camels.</p>\\n<p>Everyone thinks that their cat spends most of its life sleeping. Well, you might be right here as they do in fact spend 70% of their lives sleeping! Now, that comes to about 13-16 hours a day. Jealous much? How about the richest cat in the world whose owner left his 7-million-pound fortune to it? Definitely jealous now, right?</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_1_15\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_1_15_other\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>While all this might be extremely fascinating, today we would love to focus on the tail of the cat. Yes, the tail. Did you know that approximately 10 percent of the bones in a cat&rsquo;s body are found in the tail? It makes sense as well since their tail is the most expressive part of their anatomy.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to all the ligaments, tendons, nerves, bones, and muscles, a cat&rsquo;s tail is extremely flexible and sensitive. The tail is one of the ways for the cat to communicate with you and the other cats. So, what does it mean when a cat wags its tail at you?</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_2_29\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"innerarticle_2_29_other\\\" class=\\\"adsCent\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>When a cat is unsure about its surroundings, you will find it holding the tail, as if trying to tuck it under its body. On the other hand, when you see it walking with its tail straight up, it is a sign of confidence. If you find the tail to be extremely fluffed up, it may mean that the cat feels threatened. While stalking its prey, the cat holds its tail low and straight behind the body. If you find the tail being whipped or thrashed from side to side, it could be a sign of aggression or agitation. It would be better to simply leave the animal alone at that point.</p>\\n<p>So, when is you cat friendly, happy, and willing to play? If you find the tail having a curve or hook on the end (like an umbrella handle). And finally, when you see the feline wrapping its tail around your arm or leg, get ready for some affection and possible head butting!</p>\\n<p>So, the next time you are wondering what exactly is going on inside the mind of that lovely cat of yours, simply observe its tail! You will be able to interpret its body language and judge its mood!</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"},{\"id\":21,\"title\":\"po\",\"category\":\"op\",\"description\":\"po\",\"content\":\"<p>po</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"},{\"id\":20,\"title\":\"Grevy's zebra have about 80 stripes\",\"category\":\"Test\",\"description\":\"you know Zebras are actually black, with white stripes\\n\",\"content\":\"<p>Have you heard this popular joke: What&rsquo;s black and white and red all over?

Some believe the pattern helps in camouflage and some think the stripes act like marks of uniqueness (just like the human fingerprint).</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_1_15\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_1_15_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>There have also been theories that the stripes help in thermoregulation (a process that lets your body maintain its core internal temperature) and protection from&nbsp;biting flies. Various experiments have shown that flies tend to not land on striped surfaces. So, the protection from bites of flies seems to be a very popular theory when it comes to answering why exactly do zebras have stripes.</p>\\n<p>Guess we will have to wait for the debate to reach a consensus. Meanwhile, there is another aspect of the zebra stripes that is equally fascinating. The pattern of the stripes and the intensity is different across species and the location. While most of us think that zebras are white with black stripes, it is not really true!</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_2_29\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1769_2_29_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This common belief comes from the fact that the black stripes often end on the belly and towards the inside of the legs. This reveals that the rest of the body of the zebra is white. However, when it comes to zebras, looks are deceiving.</p>\\n<p>The fur of the zebra grows from follicles that contain&nbsp;melanocyte&nbsp;cells that are responsible for producing the melanin (a pigment that gives colour to hair and skin). When it comes to zebras, chemical messengers decide which melanocytes deliver pigment to which section of fur. This is what results in the black and white pattern and the variation in the stripes is owing to genetics.</p>\\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the white fur on the zebra is owing to an&nbsp;absence&nbsp;of melanin, and hence, the default colour of the zebra is black. If you shave a zebra, you will barely recognise it as an all-black animal. A member of the Equus genus, there are three living species of zebras in eastern and southern Africa. They have a coat of dark hair that is broken by stripes of white which is essentially unpigmented hair.</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"},{\"id\":19,\"title\":\"Right Driving-DUPLICATE\",\"category\":\"Test\",\"description\":\"Did you know almost 65 Percent of the world’s population drives on the right side of the road\\n\",\"content\":\"<p>The&nbsp;driving side&nbsp;of a road is the side where&nbsp;vehicles&nbsp;must drive.

Countries which were part of the British Empire followed suit. This is why to this very day, India, Australasia and the former British colonies in Africa go left. An exception to the rule, however, is Egypt, which had been conquered by Napoleon before becoming a British dependency.</p>\\n<p>In the early years of English colonisation of North America, English driving customs were followed and the colonies drove on the left. After gaining independence from England, however, they were anxious to cast off all remaining links with their British colonial past and gradually changed to right-hand driving.</p>\\n<p>Incidentally, the influence of other European immigrants, especially the French, should not be underestimated. The first law requiring drivers to keep right was passed in Pennsylvania in 1792, and similar laws were passed in New York in 1804 and New Jersey in 1813.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<center>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1774_2_29\\\" data-is-refresh=\\\"false\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n<div id=\\\"feedInnerArticle_1774_2_29_other\\\">&nbsp;</div>\\n</center>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Approximately two thirds of the world&rsquo;s countries which is approximately 65% of the world&rsquo;s population drives on the right side of the road. Apart from Ireland, Cyprus, Malta, and the U.K., Europe generally drives on the right hand side. Even though Canada used to drive on the left, it changed the norm to the right. It was reportedly done so that the border crossings with the U.S. could become smoother.</p>\\n<p>In Europe, the remaining left-driving countries switched one by one to driving on the right. Portugal made the switch in 1928. The change took place on the same day in the whole country, including the colonies. Territories, however, which bordered other left-driving countries were exempted. That is why Goa (now part of India) and Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique) kept the old system. East Timor, which borders left-driving Indonesia, did change to the right though, but left-hand traffic was reintroduced by the Indonesians in 1975.</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"},{\"id\":18,\"title\":\"HOME DECOR\",\"category\":\"Test\",\"description\":\"Creating Glamor In The Great Outdoors: How To Arrange A Stunning Patio\\n\",\"content\":\"<p>Elevate your al fresco experience and create a magnificent refuge in your backyard by transforming your outside space into a spectacular getaway.

To create long-lasting and fashionable furniture, pick weather-resistant materials like wrought iron, teak, or rattan. You may also invest in luxurious outdoor textiles for curtains, pillows, and cushions.</p>\\n<p><strong>Create Comfortable Seating Areas</strong></p>\\n<p>Glamorous patios are all about creating inviting and comfortable seating areas where guests can relax and socialize in style. Arrange seating in clusters to encourage conversation and interaction, and mix and match different seating options for visual interest. Consider incorporating oversized lounge chairs, plush sofas, and ottomans upholstered in luxurious fabrics for added comfort and sophistication.</p>\\n<p><strong>Add Ambient Lighting</strong></p>\\n<p>The ambience and atmosphere of your patio are greatly influenced by the lighting. Use a range of lighting components to create a cozy, welcoming ambiance that is especially lovely after dark. For a hint of glitz, suspend sophisticated chandeliers or pendant lights above sitting sections. To light paths and create a soft, romantic ambiance, add string lights, lanterns, or candles. Don't forget to add lanterns or candles on tables to provide even more atmosphere.</p>\\n<p><strong>Incorporate Glamorous Accessories</strong></p>\\n<p>Accessorizing is where you can really make your glamorous patio shine. Add layers of texture and visual interest with plush throw pillows, faux fur throws, and luxurious area rugs. Decorative elements like mirrored trays, crystal vases, and gilded accents can add a touch of old-world glamour, while statement pieces like oversized sculptures or ornate planters can serve as focal points and conversation starters.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bring in Greenery and Flowers</strong></p>\\n<p>Without rich vegetation and colourful flowers to give the area colour, texture, and vitality, no opulent patio would be complete. Use hanging planters or vertical gardens to optimize space and add potted plants, trees, and blooming shrubs to create a lush, tropical sanctuary. To heighten the impression of wealth and extravagance, use flowers with rich jewel tones such as vivid fuchsias, emerald greens, and deep purples.</p>\\n<p><strong>Consider Outdoor Entertainment</strong></p>\\n<p>To take your glamorous patio to the next level, consider incorporating outdoor entertainment options to keep guests entertained and engaged. Install a state-of-the-art outdoor sound system for music, set up a movie projector for outdoor movie nights, or create a cozy fire pit area for roasting marshmallows and sharing stories under the stars. By adding these elements, you can create a truly immersive and unforgettable outdoor experience for you and your guests.</p>\\n<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>\\n<p>The key to decorating a beautiful patio is to create an opulent outdoor space that expresses your own style and individuality. You can turn your patio into a glamorous retreat where you can unwind, entertain, and create priceless memories for years to come by using these suggestions and adding premium materials, cozy seating areas, ambient lighting, glitzy accessories, lush vegetation, and outdoor entertainment options.</p>\",\"featureImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\",\"iconImg\":\"https://thumb.ac-illust.com/b1/b170870007dfa419295d949814474ab2_t.jpeg\"},{\"id\":17,\"title\":\"Golden Spice1\",\"category\":\"Test\",\"description\":\"Things To Know About Saffron And Its Amazing Health Benefits.\\n\",\"content\":\"<p>Saffron, with its vivid golden hue and unique scent, is more than simply a culinary treasure.
